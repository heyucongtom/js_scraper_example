# js_scraper_example
This is a JS scraper based on Google Chrome extension.

The three files were originally in the companie's extension package. Due to privacy constrain, only the crawler part can be released. The popup.js is responsible to communicate with the webpage, and the getLinks.js and renew.js are used to fetch the urls from current webpage, since Chrome extension forbids the direct communication with one js file, for security reasons.
